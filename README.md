# Very Simple Coffee Machine GUI

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a coffee machine implemented in Python using PyQt5. Users can select their coffee preferences such as type of coffee, milk preference, strength, and cup size.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

After installing Python, you need to install the PyQt5 library. You can install it via pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:
```
pip install PyQt5
```
## How to Run
Once you have installed Python and PyQt5, you can run the Coffee Machine GUI by following these steps:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine or download the coffee_machine_gui.py file.**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
3. **Navigate to the directory where coffee_machine_gui.py is located.**
4. **Run the following command:**
```
python coffee_machine_gui.py
```
## How to Use
- Upon running the program, the GUI window will appear.
- Select your preferred type of coffee from the dropdown menu.
- Click the "Next" button to proceed to the next selection page.
- Choose your milk preference (with milk, without milk, or light milk) and click "Next".
- Select the strength of your coffee (mild, medium, or strong) and click "Next".
- Choose the size of your cup (small, medium, or large) and click "Confirm".
- The program will display a loading screen indicating that your coffee is being prepared.
- Once the preparation is complete, an information dialog will appear, informing you that your coffee is ready.
- Enjoy your coffee!

## Notes
Make sure you have PyQt5 installed before running the program.
You may need to adjust the styling (colors, fonts, etc.) based on your preferences or system theme.
